INNER JOIN will fetch only those records which are present in both the joined tables. 

The matching of the records is only based on the columns used for joining these two tables. INNER JOIN can also be represented as JOIN in your SELECT query.

SELECT cr.country_name, ct.continent_name

FROM continents ct

INNER JOIN countries cr 

ON ct.continent_code = cr.continent_code;


--------------------------------------------------------
LEFT JOIN will fetch all records from the left table even if those records are not present in right table

records which are not present in right table (but present in left table), SQL will return a NULL value

SELECT cr.country_name, ct.continent_name

FROM continents ct

LEFT JOIN countries cr 

ON ct.continent_code = cr.continent_code;

--------------------------------

SELF JOIN is when you join a table to itself. 

SELECT cr1.country_name

FROM countries cr1

JOIN countries cr2 

ON cr1.country_code = cr2.continent_code;

------------------------------
Natural join:
	when doing the natural join, both the tables need to have columns with same name and these columns should have same data type.
	not need to use the ON clause 
	
SELECT cr.country_name, ct.continent_name

FROM continents ct

NATURAL JOIN countries cr;

Aggregate Functions:
	
1.SELECT dept_id, SUM(salary) as total_salary_per_dept 

FROM employee 

GROUP BY dept_id;

2.SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) as avg_salary_per_dept 

FROM employee 

GROUP BY dept_id;

3.SELECT dept_id, MIN(salary) as min_salary_per_dept 

FROM employee 

GROUP BY dept_id;

4.SELECT dept_id, MAX(salary) as max_salary_per_dept 

FROM employee 

GROUP BY dept_id;

5.SELECT dept_id, COUNT(emp_id) as no_of_emp_per_dept 

FROM employee 

GROUP BY dept_id;

SQL queries:

Fetch even rows using MOD() function:
SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE MOD(PatientID,2)=0;

Fetch odd rows using MOD() function:
SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE MOD(PatientID,2)=1;
