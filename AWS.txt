AWS CLI:

pwd -> print working dir

install aws cli msi so that we can use it from local cmd
how to login: 
1.aws configure
	provide access key and secret key

1.how to generate above keys

IAM Service-> users ->click on admin user -> click on security cred tab-> access key
		create new access key since if we loose secret key there is no way to generate secret key

2.cmd to check how many users available:
		
aws iam list-users
aws iam list-groups

arn: aws resource name

we can attach he policy to group or user:
Limitation:
	As of now no solution found o view which policy we can use from CLI..we needs to know exact policy arn
	also we cannot add multiple policies once
	--above are possible using GUI
	
	we can view which policy is attached to group using CLI
